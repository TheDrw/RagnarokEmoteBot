# RagnarokEmoteBot
A discord bot that shows the emotes from the game Ragnarok Online.
An overview of the emotes can be found from  https://irowiki.org/wiki/Emotes.
This is an application of https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-i-upload-an-image.
Pretty much just copy and paste emote_bot.py into your beautiful project and it should just work or something.
